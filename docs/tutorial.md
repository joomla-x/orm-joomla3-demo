# How To Install the Joomla!X ORM on Joomla!3

 1. Unpack the development version of the desired Joomla! release into your working directory. To obtain the zip file, go to the Joomla! CMS repository on GitHub and select the version tag, eg. [Joomla! 3.8.2](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/tree/3.8.2). Click on `Clone or download`, then on `Download ZIP`.

    You need the development version, because is contains the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files with the existing dependencies.
    
 2. Go through the installation procedure as usual.
